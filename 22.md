# Project 22: Scop3PTM Next: Interactive visualization of PTM data across sequence, structure and interactions

## Abstract

Scop3PTM (https://iomics.ugent.be/scop3ptm/O00571/summary) is an integrative resource designed to visualize post-translational modification (PTM) data in sequence, structure, and biophysical context. As proteomics data continues to expand, there is a pressing need to make complex PTM information easily accessible, interactive, and interpretable for both experimentalists and computational biologists. This project aims to enhance the Scop3PTM visualization framework by introducing new, intuitive visualization strategies alongside improvements to existing modules.

In the first track, we propose novel visualization ideas focusing on bridging sequence (1D), residue contact maps (2D), Residue Interaction Networks (RINs-2.5D), and protein structures (3D). This includes displaying multiple PTMs on the same residue with biological context (tissue, subcell, disease state), peptide coverage maps from mass-spectrometry data, dynamic RINs linking PTMs and mutations, mutation proximity mapping in 3D, visualizing conformational diversity using representative structural states, and predictive visualizations of mutation-induced biophysical changes.

The second track focuses on optimizing and improving existing visualizations in Scop3PTM, such as refining the 1D feature viewer for PTMs, enhancing the Mol* 3D viewer, improving 1D-3D linking, and adding biophysical features like ligand binding regions and PTM hotspots.

This modular approach allows BioHackathon participants to choose between innovating new visualization concepts or refining existing tools, catering to diverse skill sets and interests. The ultimate goal is to transform Scop3PTM into a comprehensive and user-friendly PTM exploration platform, facilitating biological discovery from proteomics data.
