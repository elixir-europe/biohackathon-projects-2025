# Project 22: Scop3PTM Next: Interactive visualization of PTM data across sequence, structure and interactions

## Abstract

Scop3PTM (https://iomics.ugent.be/scop3ptm/O00571/summary) is an integrative resource designed to visualize post-translational modification (PTM) data in sequence, structure, and biophysical context. As proteomics data continues to expand, there is a pressing need to make complex PTM information easily accessible, interactive, and interpretable for both experimentalists and computational biologists. This project aims to enhance the Scop3PTM visualization framework by introducing new, intuitive visualization strategies alongside improvements to existing modules.

In the first track, we propose novel visualization ideas focusing on bridging sequence (1D), residue contact maps (2D), Residue Interaction Networks (RINs-2.5D), and protein structures (3D). This includes displaying multiple PTMs on the same residue with biological context (tissue, subcell, disease state), peptide coverage maps from mass-spectrometry data, dynamic RINs linking PTMs and mutations, mutation proximity mapping in 3D, visualizing conformational diversity using representative structural states, and predictive visualizations of mutation-induced biophysical changes.

The second track focuses on optimizing and improving existing visualizations in Scop3PTM, such as refining the 1D feature viewer for PTMs, enhancing the Mol* 3D viewer, improving 1D-3D linking, and adding biophysical features like ligand binding regions and PTM hotspots.

This modular approach allows BioHackathon participants to choose between innovating new visualization concepts or refining existing tools, catering to diverse skill sets and interests. The ultimate goal is to transform Scop3PTM into a comprehensive and user-friendly PTM exploration platform, facilitating biological discovery from proteomics data.

> We want to build a Vue.js components library in JavaScript for Protein visualisations using Storybook.js.

## Your profile

Check out our hacking member profile to see if it suits you: 

1. You know JavaScript well and can use Python too (not required, but nice to have).
2. You have some experience with front-end frameworks, especially building components with Vue.js.
3. You are comfortable working with data in FASTA, PDB, or mmCIF formats.

### Technical stack

- Visual components build be wrapped as Vue.js components
- We use [d3.js](https://d3js.org) plots, [sigma](https://www.sigmajs.org/)/[graphology](https://graphology.github.io) for networks representations, [nightingale-elements](https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale) for linear tracks and [Mol*]IO for 3D structure visualisation
- We aim to build a library of visual components, so all our developments will be wrapped in Storybook stories. 

**Important:** We provide you with the example files for all the tracks, so no backend required skills, neither libraries or API requests will be needed. 

## Working organisation

We have distributed the working week in three visualisation tracks: 

- Linear tracks: Lollypop, peptide fragments and stacked x-axis linear plots
- Network tracks: Node/Edge representations
- Structural tracks (1D-3D & 2.5D): build a JS wrapper for Mol* (/Molstar/) 3D visualisation component, connect linear tracks to 3D structure events
