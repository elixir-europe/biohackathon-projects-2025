# Project 2: Advancing the ELIXIR Maturity Model for RDM providers with Node-level implementation guidance

## Abstract

At the March 2025 DATAREX workshop in Bari, the ELIXIR RDM Community co-developed a first version of the Maturity Model for RDM service providers. The Maturity Model is a structured framework that helps ELIXIR Nodes assess and systematically improve their RDM services by defining progressive levels of capability across key areas. The model enables Nodes to evaluate their status across 27 indicators in four areas: strategy, legal, training, and data. A test run revealed the need for clearer descriptions, practical examples, and stronger guidance.

We propose a BioHackathon 2025 project to improve the Maturity Model’s usability and uptake across the ELIXIR network. The aim is to help Nodes identify priorities for RDM service development and support the creation or refinement of Node Data Management Strategies aligned with ELIXIR-wide efforts.

We will clarify indicator descriptions and levels, enrich the model with examples, and connect indicators to ELIXIR guidance, such as RDMkit, the Data Stewards Handbook, and the FAIR Cookbook. Where guidance is lacking, we will identify gaps and propose new material.

We will also co-create implementation suggestions to help Nodes move from assessment to action. This will evolve the Maturity Model from a static benchmarking tool into a practical framework that drives strategic planning and capacity-building across the ELIXIR ecosystem.

While other RDM maturity models exist, the enhanced ELIXIR model stands out by offering detailed, ELIXIR-specific guidance and concrete next steps, helping Nodes improve their services, benchmark progress, and grow together as a more coordinated and capable life science data infrastructure.
