# Project 31: World DOMEination: Conquering ML Metadata, One Standard at a Time


## Abstract

The adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the life sciences has been transformative, solving landmark challenges such as accurate protein structure prediction, and accelerating drug discovery. However, authors are publishing ML methods lacking core information relating to code, workflows, data and models losing value transfer back to the scientific community. Consequently, researchers are now facing a reuse and reproducibility crisis from opaque ML methods. 

In response to these challenges, the ELIXIR ML FG developed the DOME Recommendations to support transparent and reproducible ML. Following this, the DOME Registry service was launched, a database hosting curated annotations of ML methods. However, to ensure the extension of DOME Registry’s value for users, new integrations are needed. Therefore, this project aims to adopt and integrate two complementary flagship ML metadata standards - FAIR4ML schema for ML models and MLC Croissant for ML datasets into the DOME Registry.    

Metadata is an enabler of the interoperability element in FAIR. Through expanding the DOME Registry’s metadata integrations this key advancement will improve findability of models and datasets for both human users and  machines, facilitate further integrations with common ML resources (e.g. HuggingFace/Kaggle) and boost the DOME Registry functionality for the life sciences. The impact of metadata integrations cannot be understated given the proven success of the Bioschemas efforts which are now serving as the backbone for structured understanding in LLMs, and Google Dataset Search. This project aims to keep ELIXIR at the forefront of ML infrastructure innovation and most importantly put the AI in FAIR.
