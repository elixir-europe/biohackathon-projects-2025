# Project 20: New ELIXIR RIRs: Transparent and Automated Evaluation for a FAIRer Future

## Abstract

ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resources (RIRs) are fundamental in enabling seamless data integration and interoperability across life sciences. However, the representation of RIRs as a list of resources and assessment of the resources lack transparency, automation, and adaptability. In addition no process is in place for a regular annual or biannual revaluation of the resource to verify that the resource continues to meet the criteria for being an RIR.Our project aims to redefine how these resources are evaluated, re-evaluated  and maintained by developing a machine-actionable, FAIR-aligned listing that supports multiple use cases, including the ELIXIR Portfolio of FAIR-enabling resources. This project is aligned with ongoing efforts in ELIXIR Interoperability Platform (WP2) but also relates to work being done in Data and Tools platforms (e.g. CDRs).

Through an inclusive and transparent framework, we will establish automated validation checks and structured metadata, ensuring that RIRs can be easily discovered, assessed, and used by researchers and service providers. Following the defined ELIXIR RIR Roadmap, we will implement a staged development process that includes drafting the evaluation framework, integrating automation tools, testing with selected resources, and incorporating community feedback. By applying best practices in FAIR principles, sustainability, and interoperability throughout, we aim to release the new evaluation process shortly after the BioHackathon. The output will serve as a dynamic, user/machine-friendly resource that enhances accessibility, reusability, and governance of interoperability resources. Ultimately, this project will reinforce ELIXIR’s commitment to fostering best practices, community-driven collaboration, and long-term sustainability in data-driven research.
