# Project 1: A shape-driven visual interface to integrate heterogeneous biomedical databases into knowledge graphs

## Abstract

Building purpose-specific biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) remains difficult for users with domain expertise but limited coding experience, and inconsistent even for developers. Understanding knowledge base schemas is often non-trivial, and even with good documentation, it is still necessary to write the adequate SPARQL queries, data transformation rules, and document the end product with its own shape constraints. In previous biohackathons, we developed BioDataFuse as a resource that integrates several ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resources (RIRs) and ELIXIR Core Data Resources (CDRs) into KGs.

Providing researchers with interactive visual representation of data resource schema shapes can help improve data discovery and integration. This project proposes a graphical interface for low-code or no-code construction of modular KGs from RDF sources. Users will define the expected structure of their target graphs by visually editing or creating SHACL or ShEx shapes. These shapes are not used as mapping rules—as data transformation remains the domain of RDF Mapping Languages—but as reusable templates that describe the desired graph structure.

The tool will help reuse or transform shapes based on client-side expectations derived from the original resource’s constraints. These will be automatically extracted from databases using tools like ShExer and VoID-generator. These shapes will be rendered in a UML-style editor, where users can visually select and organize the data they want to include in their knowledge graphs.
