## Abstract

Knowledge graphs (KGs) can greatly increase the potential of data by revealing hidden relationships and turning it into useful information. A KG is a graph-based representation of data that stores relations between subjects, predicates and objects in triplestores. These entities are typically described in pre-defined ontologies, which increase interoperability and connect data that would otherwise remain isolated in siloed databases. This structured data representation can greatly facilitate complex querying and applications to deep learning approaches like generative AI.

ELIXIR and its Nodes are making a major effort to make the wealth of open training materials on the computational life sciences reusable, amongst others by guidelines and support for annotating training materials with standardized metadata. One major step in standardizing metadata is the use of the Bioschemas training profile, which became a standard for representing training metadata. Despite being standardized and interoperable, there is still a lot of potential to turn these resources into valuable information, linking training data across various databases.

In this project, we aim to create queryable KGs derived from training metadata in the Bioschemas format available from platforms like TeSS and glittr.org. In a subsequent step, we will investigate the potential of such KGs for several use cases, including construction of custom learning paths, creation of detailed trainer profiles, and connection of  training metadata to other databases. These use-cases will also shed light on the limits on the currently available metadata, and will help to make future choices on richer metadata and standards.
