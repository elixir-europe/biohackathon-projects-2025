# Project 8: Enriching metadata and broadening community inclusion in the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem

## Abstract

FAIR data infrastructures are key in addressing biodiversity loss. Two domains have critical roles to play in improving our response to this crisis: the sequence level and the specimen level. Together, these complementary domains can be used to monitor biodiversity changes. 

Connections between a specimen and its derived sequence data are often unavailable. Sequence data can contain metadata pertaining to the source of the sequence, but this metadata relies on identifiers provided by the specimen host institution that are often not stable nor unique. Past work has shown that it is possible, though difficult, to create automatic links between sequence data and specimen data.

Developments in the natural science collection domain have created new opportunities for creating reliable linkages between specimen data and sequence data. DiSSCo is now minting Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for digitized specimens. These DOIs unambiguously identify a specimen by assigning it a unique, resolvable identifier. This concept is also in the process of being integrated into TDWG’s DarwinCore specification. Similarly, GGBN is providing stable identifiers for samples (tissue, DNA, environmental) and specimens. Crosslinks between ENA and GGBN have been successfully explored in a previous project.

This project will work in further identifying linked objects across infrastructures using the new Digital Specimen DOI. Additionally, this project will develop services to leverage newly found links to improve data insights in both the specimen and sequence. Through creating and utilizing these linkages, we promote the overall findability of sequence and specimen information across infrastructures, contributing to global biodiversity research.
