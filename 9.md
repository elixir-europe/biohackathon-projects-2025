# Project 9: Evolving FAIR Image Analysis in Galaxy for Cross-domain and AI-ready Applications

## Abstract

The project is multi-disciplinary, cross-RI, involving Euro-BioImaging and ELIXIR members. It is multi-institutional and includes Simula as an industry partner. It also involves connections with existing ELIXIR Communities and the ISCC Foundation.

All project leads attended the past years in person and are planning to do so this year, too.

Leonid Kostrykin is an image analysis researcher in the Biomedical Computer Vision Group at Heidelberg University. He is planning to attend BioHackathon on-site.

Anup Kumar is a machine learning researcher in the Bioinformatics group at the University of Freiburg. He is planning to attend BioHackathon on-site.

Beatriz Serrano-Solano is a scientific project manager at Euro-BioImaging. She is planning to attend BioHackathon on-site.
