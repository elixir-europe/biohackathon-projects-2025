# Project 9: Evolving FAIR Image Analysis in Galaxy for Cross-domain and AI-ready Applications

## Abstract

The project is multi-disciplinary, cross-RI, involving Euro-BioImaging and ELIXIR members. It is multi-institutional and includes Simula as an industry partner. It also involves connections with existing ELIXIR Communities and the ISCC Foundation.

Leonid and Beatriz, the project leads in previous years, attended the BioHackathon in person and plan to do so again this year.  
Diana will join the BioHackathon on-site for the first time.

Leonid Kostrykin is an image analysis researcher in the Biomedical Computer Vision Group at Heidelberg University.  
Diana Chiang Jurado is a researcher in the Bioinformatics group at the University of Freiburg, focusing on single-cell and imaging analysis.  
Beatriz Serrano-Solano is a scientific project manager at Euro-BioImaging.
