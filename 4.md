# Project 4: Beyond Beacons: Establishing Genomic Background in European and International Biobanks

## Abstract

To date, there has not been a systematic approach to understand the effects of background genomic signals on the penetrance of inherited variants associated with diseases. While many studies have identified variants linked to severe or early-onset conditions, most healthy individuals carry variants associated with the disease and yet exhibit no phenotype. This suggests that secondary genomic or environmental factors affect the disease onset, but current bioinformatic methods for assessing these factors remain incomplete. In this project, we propose to integrate several prototype software packages for assessing the effects of background genomic signals on variant penetrance within an easy-to-use, computationally accelerated genomic toolkit. 

The major functions of this toolkit are as follows:

Segregate local genomic backgrounds (haploblocks) within and across large international biobanks (e.g., UK BioBank)

Develop a nomenclature system for the segregated haploblocks

Facilitate the use of these haploblocks in practical imputation systems for the established and novel sequencing technologies

Establish a toolkit for assessing the effect of these haploblocks on penetrance of mendelian variants, epigenetic sites, QTLs, and other metrics that can become public

Establish baseline metrics for populations and make the frequency counts publicly available (in collaboration with B1MG, fEGA and UK Biobank)
