# Project 12: Gene Recommendation System: Integrating Gene Features for Enhanced Research Collaboration

## Abstract

This project aims to develop a Gene Recommendation System that utilizes gene features such as sequence data, functional annotations, network properties, and research profiles to suggest relevant genes for study. 

By employing a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based methods, we will create a prototype that identifies promising genes while fostering collaboration among researchers.

Success metrics will include the accuracy of gene recommendations (measured by user feedback and research profiles), the number of unique genes suggested, and the identification of research profiles based on interaction data. Additionally, we may assess the system's ability to facilitate new research connections through follow-up surveys.

This initiative addresses a critical need in bioinformatics and provides participants with the opportunity to apply their expertise in data analysis and machine learning, ultimately contributing to more efficient research processes and interdisciplinary collaboration.
