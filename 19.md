# Project 19: MolViewSpec: A presentation layer for structural molecular data

## Abstract

Mol* - MolViewSpec development has been driven by EMBL-EBI in Europe, RCSB in USA, and Masaryk University (Czech Republic), developed primarily by David Sehnal (co-lead) and Alexander Rose (co-lead). iCn3D had been driven by NCBI and developed primarily by Jiyao Wang (NIH/NCBI) and Philippe Youkharibache (NIH/NCI).  More recently, an initiative VIZomics, has been started to develop an open source ecosystem for molecular visualization funded by the NSF (PI Ravinder Abrol) (https://nsf.elsevierpure.com/en/projects/pose-phase-i-pathway-to-icn3d-based-open-source-ecosystem-for-col). 

Co-leads are new BioHackathon Europe. Previous hackathons and workshops (Feasibility section) have involved developers and managers involved in a) Mol* and MolViewSpec at RCSB (Stephen K. Burley, Alexander Rose, Brinda Vallat, Sebastian Bittrich), EBI (Sameer Velankar, Marcelo Querino Lima Afonso, Adam Midlik, Jennifer Fleming), b)  iCn3D at NCBI (Jiyao Wang), NCI and VIZomics (Philippe Youkharibache), CSUN (Ravinder Abrol), Inside-reality (Chris Henn), and CNRS (Marc Baaden). A number of these developers will be active in preparation or during BioHackathon.
