# Project 23: Streamlining FAIR Metadata for Biodiversity Genome Annotations

## Abstract

Initiatives like the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) and Australian Tree of Life (ATOL) comprise a scientific response to the current severe threats to biodiversity, generating thousands of reference genomes for species across the tree of life. Unfortunately, few solutions exist for structured reporting, quality assessment and persistent deployment of metadata pertaining to the annotation of functional and structural features along the assembled genomes.

ERGA is developing a format and repository for annotation reports to support collection of metadata for genome annotations in line with the existing ERGA Assembly Reports (EAR). ATOL is currently building a ""Genome Engine"" capable of producing automated genome notes and INSDC submissions for genomic data. Similar initiatives exist in the context of other biodiversity projects.

In parallel, the FAIRification of Genomic Annotations Working Group (FGA-WG) in the Research Data Alliance (RDA) has been developing a secondary, harmonised FAIR metadata model and infrastructure to improve discovery and reuse of publicly available genomic annotations/tracks, across biomedical and biodiversity fields.

This project brings together – for the first time – participants from two disjoint BioHackathon projects, BH2024 project #31 and BH2023 project #20, across ERGA, ATOL, FGA-WG, Ensembl, EBP-Nor and other initiatives, to form a ""supergroup"" to tackle the metadata challenges pertaining to biodiversity genome annotations!

For the 2025 BioHackathon, we will develop automated processing, validation and transformation of collected metadata consistently deployed across repositories for ERGA Annotation Reports and ATOL Genome Notes (primary metadata), and metadata harmonised according to the recommendations from the FGA-WG group (secondary metadata).
