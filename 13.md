# Project 13: Improving package annotation in metabolomics and proteomics via robust, ontology-driven LLM integration

## :books: Background

Metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics communities face interoperability challenges despite shared platforms and analysis tools. While these communities have advanced standardisation through initiatives such as the [ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem](https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/) (RSEc) or the [EDAM-Bioconductor collaboration](https://doi.org/10.37044/osf.io/dsgnw_v1), key gaps remain:

* Manual tool annotation in bio.tools is labor-intensive and inconsistent
* Discoverability for experimentalists needs improvement
* Integration across ELIXIR services (Galaxy, WorkflowHub, Biocontainers) requires strengthening

This project will bring together contributors from various ELIXIR nodes, communities and platforms, through the usage of the EDAM ontology, the bio.tools repository and the Research Software Ecosystem. In addition, it will build on a collaboration with the Bioconductor community, initiated at the 2024 BioHackathon. 

## :dart: Goals

We seek to enhance the accessibility and interoperability of metabolomics and proteomics tools by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and automated annotations. The first steps will be to develop an LLM-based querying system for the bio.tools API and strengthen the integration between omics tools and ELIXIR services, as well as the large collection of related Bioconductor packages. Additionally, the project aims to improve end-user accessibility by facilitating structured queries and guided workflow usage, particularly through platforms like Galaxy’s Metabolomics and Proteomics environments.

## :loudspeaker: Interested in contributing? Reach out! 

**Who can participate?** 

We welcome all kinds of contributions and backgrounds: ontology experts, LLM/NLP enthusiasts, R developers, package users, or anyone with domain knowledge keen on improving software discoverability! We aim for our project to embrace all kinds of contributions and points of view from people of diverse scientific and cultural backgrounds. 

We are committed to overcoming potential language barriers, and to offering any support needed, should someone face any form of discomfort or discrimination. We stand by the [Bioconductor Code of Conduct](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct), as well as the [ELIXIR code of conduct for events](https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct) and the [ELIXIR RSEc code of conduct](https://github.com/research-software-ecosystem/content/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

Remote participation is very welcome, we will try and schedule daily update calls as much as the on-site schedule and time zones allow us to. If you're interested in participating, please reach out to ensure we can get the necessary setup ready to work during the event and have everybody able to fully enjoy and take advantage of the event!

## Abstract

Current advances in generative AI promise greater accessibility of bioinformatics tools for a wide range of users. However, these advances need to be connected—robustly—to existing infrastructure, such as bio.tools and Bioconductor, to allow users to benefit from the technologies. We propose to leverage the diverse expertise of the co-leads (knowledge management and LLM technology, domain expertise in metabolomics and proteomics, and bioinformatics ontologies) to prototype a robust framework for curating and interrogating EDAM and bio.tools. We aim to go beyond currently prevailing ad-hoc approaches to applying LLMs in curation by using recent developments in LLM technology (tool binding, structured outputs, constrained generation) in order to increase reliability of LLM outputs both for annotation of packages and for helping bio.tools users. By establishing a dedicated benchmark in an existing, actively maintained software framework (BioChatter), we aim to monitor the performance of this system based on a dedicated set of user questions from the domain of metabolomics/proteomics. We will also look for ways to facilitate updates for the ontology underlying bio.tools package annotation (EDAM) that are in line with the faster pace of introduction of new technologies. Ultimately, we aim to improve the efficiency of both the input of package information into bio.tools as well as the user interaction with the platform.
