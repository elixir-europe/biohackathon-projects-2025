# Project 13: Improving package annotation in metabolomics and proteomics via robust, ontology-driven LLM integration

## Abstract

Current advances in generative AI promise greater accessibility of bioinformatics tools for a wide range of users. However, these advances need to be connected—robustly—to existing infrastructure, such as bio.tools and Bioconductor, to allow users to benefit from the technologies. We propose to leverage the diverse expertise of the co-leads (knowledge management and LLM technology, domain expertise in metabolomics and proteomics, and bioinformatics ontologies) to prototype a robust framework for curating and interrogating EDAM and bio.tools. We aim to go beyond currently prevailing ad-hoc approaches to applying LLMs in curation by using recent developments in LLM technology (tool binding, structured outputs, constrained generation) in order to increase reliability of LLM outputs both for annotation of packages and for helping bio.tools users. By establishing a dedicated benchmark in an existing, actively maintained software framework (BioChatter), we aim to monitor the performance of this system based on a dedicated set of user questions from the domain of metabolomics/proteomics. We will also look for ways to facilitate updates for the ontology underlying bio.tools package annotation (EDAM) that are in line with the faster pace of introduction of new technologies. Ultimately, we aim to improve the efficiency of both the input of package information into bio.tools as well as the user interaction with the platform.
