# Project 29: Towards repository-scale quality control in proteomics


## Abstract

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has generated a wealth of publicly available data, with the PRIDE repository alone hosting over 31,000 datasets under the ProteomeXchange consortium. These datasets represent an untapped goldmine for re-analysis, benchmarking, and machine learning applications. However, their reuse is often hindered by a critical lack of standardized metadata and quality control (QC) information, making it difficult for researchers to assess data suitability for downstream applications.

To overcome this barrier, the HUPO-PSI has developed community-driven standards such as mzQC for reporting mass spectrometry QC metrics and SDRF-Proteomics for capturing rich experimental metadata. Despite their potential, adoption of these formats remains limited in public repositories due to the absence of mandatory deposition requirements.

In this BioHackathon project, we will unlock the value of open proteomics data by building a general-purpose framework to enrich public datasets with standardized QC information. Using SDRF metadata to guide reanalysis, we will generate corresponding mzQC files through automated pipelines. These outputs will be integrated into an intuitive online dashboard, enabling researchers to easily explore, filter, and select datasets based on robust QC metrics and experimental annotations. This project will pave the way toward more transparent, reusable, and FAIR proteomics data - empowering the community to harness the full potential of public repositories.
