# Project 10: Expanding the Benchmarking Landscape for Long-Read-Transcriptomics including Novel Datasets and Pipelines

## Abstract

The Long-read RNA-Seq Genome Annotation Assessment Project (LRGASP) established a foundational benchmark for transcriptome data generated using long-read sequencing technologies, particularly Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore (PMID: 38849569). It produced the first version of a continuous benchmarking platform within the OpenEBench framework, assessing transcript reconstruction methods both with and without high-quality genome annotations.

However, the data and tools evaluated during LRGASP were defined in 2020. Since then, the field has rapidly evolved. Numerous new library preparation protocols for both PacBio and Nanopore, as well as updated or newly developed analysis tools, have been introduced. This surge in innovation has been recognized by leading journals—such as Genome Research, Genome Biology, and Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics—through dedicated special issues.

As a result, while LRGASP remains a valuable reference, it no longer reflects the current landscape. Similar limitations are evident in other recent benchmarking efforts (PMID: 37783886, PMID: 40082608).

This BioHackathon proposal aims to launch an updated benchmark for the long-read transcriptomics field, building on past work and leveraging new datasets from active consortia. The initiative will help establish European, ELIXIR-based leadership in long-read transcriptome benchmarking.

The resulting benchmarks will enhance the reproducibility and comparability of long-read transcriptomics research, support broader adoption across disciplines, and contribute to a robust ecosystem of best practices and analytical tools.
