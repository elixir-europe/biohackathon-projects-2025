# Project 15: METRICS - Monitoring of Key Performance Indicators for ELIXIR Services

## Abstract

In the evolving life sciences landscape, policy stakeholders and funders increasingly require transparent insights into the impact of research infrastructure services through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). While these metrics support strategic planning and resource allocation, they also offer significant value to service providers and users by enabling continuous quality improvement based on informed decision-making.

Currently, KPI monitoring is inconsistently implemented across ELIXIR nodes, limiting the ability to assess service impact, and opportunities for alignment with community needs. This project aims to close that gap by designing a robust organisational and technical strategy for a sustainable evaluation framework across ELIXIR services.

We will analyse existing evaluation criteria and KPIs to define a systematic, reproducible approach to measuring service impact. The framework will respect the diverse organisational and technical contexts of service providers, ensuring flexibility while maintaining coherence across the infrastructure.

Key components include identifying meaningful metrics, providing guidance for consistent and comparable data collection, and raising awareness among stakeholders of the benefits of continuous service monitoring. Community engagement is a strong project focus to drive adoption and ensure the framework reflects the needs of ELIXIR communities.

The long-term vision is to deliver a unified, user-friendly monitoring platform—a “one-stop shop”—that integrates multiple indicators to provide a comprehensive view of service performance. This will include essential service metadata, supporting more transparent, evidence-based evaluations.

Ultimately, this initiative will enhance ELIXIR’s ability to adapt, evolve, and demonstrate value, ensuring its services continue to meet the needs of the life science community.
