# Project 14: Metabolomics and Proteomics file format interoperability fest

## Abstract

Data standardisation of software input/output is needed in life-sciences. The mzTab format family was developed by the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI), capturing design and results of Metabolomics and Proteomics experiments. mzTab uses OBO ontologies for metadata and experimental outcomes (processed results). The mzTab 1.0 format for Proteomics (10.1074/mcp.O113.036681) has seen adoption in tools and as submission format for EMBL-EBIâ€™s PRIDE repository.

mzTab-M 2.0 was adapted to Metabolomics for interoperability between tools and data repositories, and published six years ago (10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04310). Initial support exists in software and ecosystems (e.g., mzMine, MS-Dial, xcms, RforMassSpectrometry, MetaboAnalyst, GNPS, Galaxy tools, and a prototype for submission to the ELIXIR deposition database MetaboLights EBI-Metabolights/mztabm2mtbls). The backwards-compatible mzTab-M 2.1 specification update is currently under development. However, the format is complex and full interoperability between all implementations was never fully tested. 

In this Biohackathon project, we are going to 1) collect a large and broad collection of mzTab-M files from various sources, 2) test available producers and consumers for compatibility, and 3) test advanced functionality, interoperability, and information content. We will 4) report errors and missing information upstream, or even work on fixes during the hackathon, which can in turn be discussed and tested during the project. Finally, we will 5) discuss and polish future versions of mzTab-M.

While the focus will be on mzTab, we can extend the approach to other metabolomics or proteomics formats depending on final participants.
