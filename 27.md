# Project 27: Towards a more scalable, sustainable, and integrated Research Data Management Ecosystem

## Abstract

The Research Data Management toolkit (RDMkit) is an online resource designed to help researchers manage their data effectively throughout the research process. The toolkit and RDM ecosystem proved to be useful resources and grew with time (four times in number of contributors, tools and pages; twice in unique visitors per month).  As these resources have expanded, there are new opportunities to further enhance their scalability and efficiency, ensuring they continue to meet the evolving demands. This project aims to tackle these challenges using a holistic approach rather than focusing on the isolated components of the ecosystem. This will ensure native interoperability across services and a seamless and more effective support system for researchers and RDM professionals.

On the technical side, the hackathon will address the interoperability and scalability of navigation structures in the RDMkit. We will also explore strategies for proper citation of the resource and editorial work acknowledgment. Improvements to the RDMkit are beneficial to all ELIXIR Toolkit Theme (ETT)-based resources, enhancing the technical robustness of platforms like DS Handbook. In addition, the project will enhance existing interconnections between resources, ensuring long-term sustainability of external reference links within the DSW knowledge models. 

From a process perspective, we aim to examine the role of shared editorial practices in fostering a more cohesive RDM ecosystem. Drawing lessons from established editorial boards, the workshop will explore governance models and editorial workflows that can support living resources, particularly focusing on elevating the DS Handbook into a technically mature, community-driven resource.
