# Project 24: Sustainable computing in Galaxy through reuse and energy-aware job scheduling

## Abstract

Workflow management systems (WMSs), such as Galaxy, are well-suited to improving the sustainability of computational data analysis. By tracking and reusing previous computations, these systems can reduce redundant processing and lower resource consumption. Additionally, WMSs can facilitate workload distribution across energy-efficient infrastructures, balancing performance with a reduced environmental footprint.

In this project we will build on the work done in Project 26 at BioHackathon Europe 2024 to advance computation reuse in Galaxy. We aim to improve its job caching mechanism - which uses the provenance information stored in Galaxyâ€™s database to avoid unnecessary recalculations - by making it more effective and user-friendly. Our key goals are to ensure that datasets are not modified after creation, and to then enable the use of dataset hashes in the job cache to match job inputs more effectively. We will validate this approach using production workflows from the Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC) and the Galaxy Training Materials.

In parallel, building on the BioHackathon 2024 groundwork on a metascheduler for Galaxy's Total Perspective Vortex (TPV) plugin, we will integrate additional factors into its fuzzy matchmaking algorithm. This system will intelligently rank job destinations based on historical performance data, job resource requirements, compute location (to minimise network latency and cross-border data transfers), and data proximity.

To support energy-aware job scheduling, we will identify API providers offering real-time energy metrics, including electricity availability and carbon intensity. We will establish a new service to collect and store these metrics, enabling future integration into TPV for dynamic, sustainability-driven job scheduling.
