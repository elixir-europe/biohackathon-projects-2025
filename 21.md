# Project 21: Opening the TMD: making it more Usable, Visible, and Connected

## Abstract

This project aims to extend the functionality of the Training Metrics Database (TMD) by introducing a new API endpoint and customizable widgets.

The Training Metrics Database (TMD) is an ELIXIR multi-node service that aggregates and measures the impact of training across the ELIXIR nodes. It is an important resource for nodes in collecting and summarizing training statistics from their respective nodes. As part of a longer term plan of updating and making the TMD more user friendly, as well as relevant to communities outside of ELIXIR, we propose the development of an API to enable interaction with the database. Adding an API to the system is important for laying the foundation for future integrations and collaborations, with the goal of fully integrating the TMD into the ELIXIR ecosystem. This will, for example, make it possible for nodes to build custom automatic uploads to the TMD, reducing manual work, or connecting several ELIXIR systems together with the TMD. On top of the API we will also build a customizable widget that nodes can use to display their training statistics on websites, thereby showing their impact.

We will assemble a cross-functional team of web developers and people involved in training and training impact, to ensure we deliver solutions tailored to the needs of the ELIXIR Training community.
