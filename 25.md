# Project 25: The BioHackCloud

## Abstract

We propose the further consolidation of the BioHackCloud (BHC), a cloud service aggregator offered to BioHackathon participants, with BHC project participants providing training and support for the realization of individual use cases. Use cases not yet supported by the BHC will be considered for on-demand implementation (ahead of time or on site) or the project roadmap.

The core services offered within the BHC are operated by the ELIXIR On Cloud initiative and are based on open community standards set by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards and others. Currently available use cases include the execution of Snakemake and Nextflow workflows, interactive analyses via JupyterHub, data storage in an S3-compatible object store, collaborative markdown editing, and were established during BioHackEU 2023 and 2024. The mid- to long-term plans of the project involve the support of complex federated computing use cases and integrating them with additional academic and commercial cloud infrastructures like Sapporo, Galaxy/Pulsar, Microsoft Azure, and Nebius.

Next to supporting other BioHackathon projects, a core focus of this BioHackEU iteration will be placed on implementing enhanced data privacy and security features. In particular, we are planning to add support for Crypt4GH-encrypted files and Confidential Computing in workflow analyses. However, integration with other community standards (e.g., RO-Crate), implementations (e.g., WorkflowHub, BioContainers) and use cases (e.g., federated learning) is also possible, depending on participantsâ€™ interests.
