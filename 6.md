# Project 6: Defining the components of an ELIXIR ML Ecosystem

## Abstract

The landscape of scientific machine learning (ML) has rapidly evolved in recent years due to landmark successes such as AlphaFold and the rise of powerful LLMs. This has captured the attention of life scientists looking to leverage the potential of ML for tackling life science challenges such as drug discovery and medical imaging for diagnosis. However, given the complex nature of ML and diverse skill set needed in the scientific domain of application, statistics and computing it has led to the widespread output of poorly described models. These ML models are generally implemented without best practice adherence and lead to issues with reproducibility, interpretability, trustworthiness and, when published, lack reuse potential for the wider scientific community. 



This BioHackathon project proposes to build upon successful efforts of the DOME Recommendations & DOME Registry by expanding ELIXIR’s understanding, engagement and federation efforts across and beyond its existing ML/AI ecosystem. Focuses of the workshop include charting efforts in ML/AI best practices beyond supervised ML, assessing new ML/AI standards (Croissant/FAIR4ML), understanding ELIXIR’s use of ML/AI repositories and tooling such as model registries (HuggingFace/Kaggle/+) and contemporary approaches such as LLMs. Once landscaped and discussed, these ML/AI efforts will feed into discussion on expanding ELIXIRs flagship DOME Recommendations, extending DOME Registry connections and form the strategic direction to build a robust ML/AI ecosystem in ELIXIR supported by the ELIXIR ML FG.
